We welcome contributions in various forms! Here are a few ways you can get involved:

### 1. Reporting Bugs

If you come across a bug, please follow these steps:

- Check the [issues](https://github.com/qiaopengjun5162/xiandong-tennis/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

  - A clear description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - Any relevant logs or screenshots.

### 2. Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? We'd love to hear it! Please:

- Search through existing issues to see if your idea is already suggested.
- If not, open a new issue with a clear description of the feature, why it's valuable, and any additional context.

### 3. Submitting Code Changes

Before you start coding, please:

- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Create a new branch for your changes. For example: `feature/awesome-feature` or `fix/bug-description`.
- Make your changes in this branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and the code is properly linted.

When your changes are ready:

1. Commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages (refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for guidance).
2. Push your branch to your fork.
3. Create a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the `xiandong-tennis` repository.

### 4. Code Style and Testing

- **Rust**: Follow the [Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html). Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --tests --benches -- -D warnings`.
- **TypeScript / Next.js**: Follow the existing style. Run `cd apps/web && pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck`.
- **Testing**: Ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality. Run the tests before submitting a PR:

  ```bash

  cd apps/web && pnpm build
  ```

  If you add new features, be sure to add relevant tests.
